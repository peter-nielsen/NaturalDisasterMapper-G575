        <p>Hazardous weather doesn't always mean that it'll be an iminent threat.</p>
        <div id="left-half">
          <h3>Avalanches</h3>
          <p>An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a hill or mountainside. Although avalanches can occur on any slope given the right conditions, certain times of the year and
          certain locations are naturally more dangerous than others. Wintertime, particularly from December to April, is when most avalanches tend to happen. However, avalanche
          fatalities have been recorded for every month of the year.</p>
          <h3>Blizzards</h3>
          <p>Blizzards are dangerous winter storms that are a combination of blowing snow and wind resulting in very low visibilities. While heavy snowfalls and severe cold often
          accompany blizzards, they are not required. Sometimes strong winds pick up snow that has already fallen, creating a ground blizzard.
          Officially, the National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a storm which contains large amounts of snow OR blowing snow, with winds in excess of 35 mph and visibilities
          of less than 1/4 mile for an extended period of time (at least 3 hours). When these conditions are expected, the National Weather Service will issue a "Blizzard Warning". When these conditions
          are not expected to occur simultaneously, but one or two of these conditions are expected, a "Winter Storm Warning" or "Heavy Snow Warning" may be issued.
          Blizzard conditions often develop on the northwest side of an intense storm system. The difference between the lower pressure in the storm and
          the higher pressure to the west creates a tight pressure gradient, or difference in pressure between two locations, which in turn results in very strong winds. These strong winds pick up available
          snow from the ground, or blow any snow which is falling, creating very low visibilities and the potential for significant drifting of snow.</p>
          <h3>Droughts</h3>
          <p>Drought is a deficiency in precipitation over an
              extended period, usually a season or more, resulting
              in a water shortage causing adverse impacts on
              vegetation, animals, and/or people. It is a normal,
              recurrent feature of climate that occurs in virtually all
              climate zones, from very wet to very dry. Drought is a
              temporary aberration from normal climatic conditions,
              thus it can vary significantly from one region to
              another. Drought is different than aridity, which is a
              permanent feature of climate in regions where low
              precipitation is the norm, as in a desert.
              Human factors, such as water demand and water
              management, can exacerbate the impact that drought
              has on a region. </p>
          <h3>Excessive Heat</h3>
          <p>Issued within 12 hours of the onset of the following criteria: heat index of at least 105Â°F for more than 3
          hours per day for 2 consecutive days, or heat index more than 115°F for any period of time.</p>
          <h3>Extreme cold</h3>
          <p>Extremely cold air comes every winter in at least part of the country and affect millions of
          people across the United States. The arctic air, together with brisk winds, can lead to dangerously cold wind chill values.
          People exposed to extreme cold are susceptible to frostbite in a matter of minutes.
          Hypothermia is another threat during extreme cold. Cold weather can also affects crops. In late spring or early fall, cold air
          outbreaks can damage or kill produce for farmers, as well as residential plants and flowers.</p>
          <h3>Tornado</h3>
          <p>A violently rotating column of air, usually pendant to a cumulonimbus, with circulation reaching the ground.
           It nearly always starts as a funnel cloud and may be accompanied by a loud roaring noise. On a local scale, it is the most destructive of all atmospheric phenomena.</p>
          <h3>Wildfire</h3>
          <p>Any free burning uncontainable wildland fire not prescribed
          for the area which consumes the natural fuels and spreads in response to its environment.</p>
